  ~ðŸ§ ~ Variable Drills ~ðŸ§ ~
  If an instruction does not tell you what to name your variable,
  assume you can name it anything you want.

  If an instruction does not tell you the type of variable 
  to declare, use a string.

  Use double quotes by default.

  Include a semi-colon after all of your variable declarations;

  The three keywords that can be used to declare variables are
    - var myName = "value";
    - const myName = 25; 
    - let myTummy = "full";
