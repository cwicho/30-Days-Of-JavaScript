  ~ðŸ§ ~ String Drills ~ðŸ§ ~

  Strings are characters wrapped in quotes.

  These can be 'single', "double", and `backtick.`

  The `backticks` are called template literals, and 
  allow us to do cool stuff like this ...*/

  const packageMessage = `Order #${orderNumber} is ready to ship!`;/*

  Note the $dollar sign$ and {braces} that surround the variable.

  The instructions may be a bit sparse, do your best to write
  full sentences pls ðŸ™ƒ
